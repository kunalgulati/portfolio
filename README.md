# Kunal Gulati Portfolio
While applying for jobs I was having a hard time putting and describing all my projects on a single-page document. I also wanted to see how long will it take me to build a portfolio from scratch? So I made this it :D 


## Getting Started
After cloning the Porject run the following commands 

```bash
yarn add 
```

### Development Enviornment: 
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

First, run the development server:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Production Enviornment:
```bash
yarn run build
yarn run start
```

### Prerequisites

Following libraries are requirement
1. yarn 
2. next 
3. React
